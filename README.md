### Machine learning project - Titanic survival exploration algorithm

In this project I create decision functions that attempt to predict survival outcomes from the 1912 Titanic disaster based on each passengerâ€™s features, such as sex and age which accurately predict the outcomes for at least 80% of the passengers in the provided data.
